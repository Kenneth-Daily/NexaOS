# NexaOS

NexaOS utilizes unmodified Debian packages. The source code for all packages is accessible at https://sources.debian.org/ or via the command `apt-get source <package-name>`.

NexaOS is incompatible with secure boot. If you have Windows BitLocker enabled but secure boot is disabled, you’ll be prompted to enter a recovery key. To fix this, turn on secure boot. 

The default user is “customuser” and the password is “password”.
